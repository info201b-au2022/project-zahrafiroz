| .gitignore | This  file is important. It tells git to ignore all files that are listed therein. Ignoring "non-useful" files will make it *much* easier to work togther in your team. See Freeman and Ross (2019, section 3.6) for details.  |
| app.r | The file used to compile our shiny website.  |
| LICENSE | This is a straigtforward software license that basically says "You own the copyright of your code.  Others can use your code, so long as they cite that they are doing so." You should put your names into the LICENSE file. If you would like to use a different license, that would be fine! |
