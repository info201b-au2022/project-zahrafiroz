Austin has a long history of systemic racism and racial inequity that continues to impact communities in the Eastern Crescent. Throughout Austin’s history, communities of color have been excluded, marginalized, and discriminated against as a result of City policies and practices. This has led to a disproportionate impact of air pollution, heat exposure and flood risk in historically Black and Latinx neighbourhoods due to industrialization and inadequate infrastructure. Working with faculty at the University of Texas at Austin, students and staff conducted a multi-risk assessment that considers how social vulnerability and hazard risk interact. The findings identify specific neighbourhoods (spatially designated as census block groups) that score relatively high on social vulnerability and face relatively high hazard risk.The health-related multi-risk assessment considers hazard and vulnerability interactions. In some socially vulnerable census block groups, there may exist risk from a single hazard. In other census block groups, the exposure to multiple hazard risks is relatively high. The possibility of cascading or domino effects amplify the overall risk and present challenges to community resilience. The spatial exposure of independent hazards include: a. Flooding (specifically, riverine/creek flooding) b. Wildfire & grassfires c. Extreme heat d. Drought/Air Quality and, e. unexpected hazards such as severe cold. These hazards can lead to or perpetuate a multitude of health conditions, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases."

Climate justice has to do with inequalities: factors such as physical condition, health, age, gender, socio-economic situation or the conditions in the environments we live and work in determine the extent to which climate change affects people. In fact, it is believed that the climate crisis is thebiggest threat to health this century. Sustained, excessive heat leads to an increase in mortality and morbidity, especially among the most vulnerable groups of human beings, but also the rest of the natural world. It has been estimated that, between 1992 and 2015in Barcelona, 980 deaths among men and 2,729 among women (natural deaths of people aged 25 and over) were attributable to extreme heat, generally fragile older people. To reduce the vulnerability of people to climate change, we need to work on ensuring the continuity of services and universal access to basic supplies, guaranteeing thermal comfort both inside buildings (housing, facilities, etc.) and in public spaces, as well as improving and adapting the services to dependent persons. We need to advance towards becoming a healthy city that ensures the health and well-being of its citizens. A socially just city that reduces inequalities. And a habitable, comfortable city with quality public spaces. Most important challenges in Barcelona are:• Reducing the vulnerability of people to the climate crisis, understood to mean those situations that mean some people adapt less well to their effects, either because of their socio-economic situation (family income, housing conditions, doing demandingphysical activities outdoors), characteristics (gender, age, situation of solitude) or health (people with limited autonomy, chronic diseases, etc).• Cutting NOx and PM emissions, the main local pollutants which directly affect the health of Barcelona’s population and that of the surrounding area.• Reducing vulnerability and energy poverty.• Improving thermal and acoustic comfort in the city: in homes, sensitive facilities and public spaces.• Improving our knowledge of the impact climate change has on health, as well as social and gender inequalities.• Preventing and controlling possible alterations in the geographical and seasonal distribution of vectors (mosquitoes and others) and the diseases they can transmit.•Improving the accessibility (physical and economic) of healthy, fair-trade and sustainable foods, especially among people in a vulnerable situation.• Promoting healthier diets low in emissions: more local, fresh and seasonal produce, more fruit and vegetables, more ecological produce, less packaging, fewer highly processed foods, reducing the consumption of animal protein (above all red meat) and prioritising meat that comes from extensive and ecological stockbreeding"

This will be undertaken by the 'Manchester Health, Wellbeing and Climate Change Independent Advisory Group, once established during 2021-22. Its establishment has been delayed due to COVID. http://www.manchesterclimate.com/advisory-groupsThis has been scoped in Manchester Climate Risk: a framework for understanding hazards and vulnerability. This report, published in May 2021 states:The adverse direct impacts of climate change – particularly from flooding and higher summer temperatures/ heatwaves - on human health could be considerable. They will involve both exacerbating existing health inequalities and the introduction of new health risks for people. Notably, Greater Manchester is referred to as a ‘Marmot city-region’; a place necessitating innovative cross sectoral governance responses to address significant health in-equalities (Codling & Allen, 2020). Health inequalities and the impacts on recovery from shocks were further demonstrated by recent work by Public Health England (2020) outlining disparities in the risk and outcomes from COVID19 across a range of population characteristics (see also Marmot et al, 2020).The human health impacts of climate change may disproportionately affect those who are already vulnerable, for example, older people, very young people, people living in socio-economic deprivation and those with underlying health conditions. Demonstrating this, heatwaves and air pollution exacerbated by climate conditions or moorland fires can cause death and serious illness, particularly in the elderly, children and those with pre-existing respiratory illness and cardio-vascular disease. Flood water poses a (relatively small) risk of drowning and may harbour disease. Households that flood, but for whatever reason are unable to relocate either during the flood event or the process of reconstruction, report ill-health from living in damp homes.Experience of hazards can generate severe mental health and emotional impacts that may outlast the immediate impacts of events. For instance, communities that have suffered from flooding often report impacts in mental health several years after specific flood events. In the longer-term, climate change could increase the risk of new pathogens and diseases borne by invasive insect species.It is possible that warmer summers and milder winters will encourage greater use of the outdoors and greenspace, potentially bringing benefits to physical and mental health.Climate change will have likely impacts on the delivery of functional human health and social care services. There are two key dimensions to this: 1.How climate change will directly impact staff, facilities and the effective delivery of essential human health and social care services. This might include disruption to buildings through flooding or other weather related damage, staff shortages during extreme weather events, or disruption caused by outages to critical infrastructure such as road and public transport networks, power and water supply and/ or IT and communication systems. 2.How climate change will drive further/ or a new demand for services. For instance, heatwaves may put pressure on acute medical services. Dislocation from floods and storms might increase pressure on social services and GP services. There may also be longer term stresses on services given that climate change is likely to increase chronic physical and mental health challenges."

As well as driving climate change, the main cause of CO2 emissions – the extraction and burning of fossil fuels – is also a major source of air pollutants. What’s more, many air pollutants contribute to climate change by affecting the amount of incoming sunlight that is reflected or absorbed by the atmosphere, with some pollutants warming and others cooling the Earth. These short-lived climate-forcing pollutants (SLCPs) include methane, black carbon, ground-level ozone, and sulphate aerosols. They have significant impacts on the climate: black carbon and methane in particular are among the top contributors to global warming after CO2.Poor air quality is the largest environmental risk to the public’s health. Taking action to improve air quality is crucial to improve the health of the general population. Whilst air quality has been generally improving over time, particular pollutants remain a serious concern in many urban areas including across Manchester.Air pollution affects the health of people living, working and travelling in Greater Manchester. Pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2) which is the harmful oxide of nitrogen (NOx), and particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) that are not visible to the naked eye are found at dangerous levels in many urban areas and on busy roads. Road transport causes two-thirds of NOx emissions and nearly 80% of PM emissions at the roadside. Diesel vehicles are the main source of road-based NOx emissions in Greater Manchester, and older vehicles are typically more polluting than newer vehicles. Large vehicles such as lorries are the most polluting from the exhaust pipe, and in general, diesel vehicles contribute the most. Breathing in polluted air contributes to the equivalent of 1,200 deaths a year in Greater Manchester. Both long and short term exposure to air pollution are known to adversely affect health. It affects people’s lungs in the short and long term, worsening respiratory issues such as asthma or bronchitis, as well as cardiovascular problems, and reduces life expectancy. Health damage caused by air pollution can begin as early as a baby’s first few weeks in the womb and exposure over a long time can lead to heart and lung disease. The most vulnerable in society are hit hardest – children, older people and those already in poor health. Everyone is at risk. But people who spend more time in areas with a high concentration of air pollution are most affected – which can include drivers. The air you breathe inside your vehicle can be dirtier than the air outside so people who spend a lot of time in their cars, taxis, vans or lorries are particularly at risk. The people living in places with the dirtiest air are often those least likely to drive, and some of the Greater Manchester’s most deprived communities suffer the worst air pollution as they live close to busy roads. In total, it is estimated that the health and social care costs of air pollution in England could reach £5.3 billion by 20355 unless action is taken. Changing the vehicles we drive and how we travel can clean up our air. This will require residents and businesses to take action, with Greater Manchester’s local authorities leading the way. Action is already underway, and this Clean Air Plan will bring forward Measures to bring illegally high roadside NO2 levels within legal limits as soon as possible."

Health.•Important considerations include age, those with pre – existing conditions, economic resources, and location.•Age - Southend has an aging population more susceptible to risk due to extreme heat this can include respiratory & cardiovascular disease – Southend CVD profile December 2020 shows Southend has a higher prevalence of CHD admissions & heart failure admissions than the England average. •All ages can be affected by Pollen, other aeroallergen, and harmful air pollutants. high in extreme heat can trigger asthma and impact on additional respiratory illnesses.  •Extreme heat events can trigger a variety of heat stress conditions, such as heat stroke. Heat stroke is the most serious heat-related disorder. It occurs when the body becomes unable to control its temperature. Body temperature rises rapidly, the sweating mechanism fails, and the body cannot cool down. This condition can cause death or permanent disability if emergency treatment is not given. Small children, the elderly, and certain other groups including people with chronic diseases, low-income populations, and outdoor workers have higher risk for heat-related illness. Higher temperatures and respiratory problems are also linked. •Ozone depletion alongside climate change- Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light from the sun is thought to cause most melanomas – skin cancer. More than 1 in 4 skin cancer cases are diagnosed in people under 50.•Location - Extreme weather events, changes in the prevalence and geographical distribution of food- and water-borne illnesses and other infectious diseases, and threats to mental health.•Increased flooding due to rising sea levels impact on resources, including residents, business and environment and mental health. •Urban heat islands are not a new phenomenon, but their impacts increase with climate change – a long term issue – decision makers in London have forecast as a future issue. – increase of green infrastructure."

The city centre has flooded in recent years (Nov 2019). The Environment Agency recognises the need for increased spending on flood defences, but notes that real terms funding for flood risk management fell 10% 2010-2015.Floodwater can be fast flowing and is very likely to be contaminated with pathogens – presenting risks of drowning, injury, and disease. A third of flood-related deaths are by drowning in a vehicle. Human sewage can flow into flood water as it spills out of overflowing drains, septic tanks and toilets. Although outbreaks of infectious disease from flooding are rare in the UK, the longer-term health effects result from displacement, shortages of safe water, injuries, disruption of access to health services and delayed recovery.Those with physical limitations may find escaping flood waters more challenging, particularly if flooding is sudden. This puts them at greater risk of drowning or injury.Physical and mental health may be affected during and after flooding and studies have shown that stress may continue for a long time after the water has receded. Mental health is impacted by both the stress of experiencing the flood, and the process cleaning up and recovery after a flood. If the clean-up and recovery process is more challenging, or has ongoing implications for the lives of those flooded, the effect on mental health can be more severe. Already suffering financial hardship is likely to limit recovery – such as the ability to replace belongings. Thus, low-income households are likely to be impacted more. The effects of being separated from family and friends, disruption to family life and daily routine and the loss of pets and possessions can all have a dramatic effect on children and can be ongoing."

Due to this the city warns the population to not swim in rivers and the fjord 24 hours after these events. Projections suggest that new species in water due to higher temperatures in the fjord can cause wound infections. In a medium-term perspective the probability of injuries caused by heavy precipitation is increasing, however the city plan for managing storm water and urban flooding to prevent this from happening. Higher temperatures increases the probability of invasive vector-borne species. In addition, higher temperatures and drought affects the public health, especially small children, eldery and persons with medical conditions.

Ground-level ozone (a key component of smog) is associated with many health problems, such as diminished lung function, increased hospital admissions, emergency room visits for asthma, and increases in premature deaths. According to the City of Houston’s Climate Action Plan, Tailpipe emissions, which comprise 47% of Houston’s total GHG emissions, worsen air quality and threaten the public’s overall health. Extreme heat events have constantly threatened public health in Houston. Heat is even more concerning in underserved communities that are less likely to have central air conditioning. Deaths result from heat stroke and related conditions, but also from cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, and cerebrovascular disease. Extreme summer heat is increasing in Houston, and climate projections indicate that extreme heat events will be more frequent and intense in coming decades. Houston will go from experiencing 10 days a year with a heat index of 105 or more during our hot summers today to 74 days a year by 2050.Flooding may be the most significant mass health issue Houston regularly faces. It is an ongoing threat and its consequences can be devastating. Sitting only 50 feet above sea level, streets tend to flood easily and often (Urban Flooding). Flooding poses a number of different public health risks, both during and after the event, including: Drowning incidents, injuries that can occur in areas covered by floodwater, such as falling into manholes or stepping on foreign objects; Infection or illness resulting from exposure to flood water containing bacteria, chemicals or human waste; Illness from drinking contaminated tap water or water from lakes and streams; Illness resulting from mold exposure due to growth on water-damaged surfaces in homes, schools, or businesses."

Studies have shown that mental health is a significant factor, although no specific studies have been done on the Toronto population.  Flooding of basements is a particular issue as Toronto upgrades its sewer systems to handle more frequent  larger storms that the sewers were never designed to handle.

The concentration of small particles reaches dangerously high concentrations during these periods. No epidemiologic research has linked yet, as far as we know, death rates in Athens with these incidents, but there is certainly greater morbidity and mortality risk during this period. Nonetheless, epidemiologic research in the USA and in Italy have linked the increase of small particles concentration with the increase of deaths from COVID-19.Morbidity and mortality has been linked to high temperatures that the city faces in summer and to heat waves by many epidemiologic research papers (Natsos & Matzarakis, 2012; Pantavou et al, 2011;  Katsouyanni et al, 1993).Katsouyanni, K., Pantazopoulou, A., Touloumi, G., Tselepidaki, I., Moustris, K., Asimakopoulos, D., ... & Trichopoulos, D.

Estos indicadores, muestran que, por ejemplo, los casos de ESRI-IRAG aumentan en la temporada de lluvias de la ciudad. En 2020, el 77,% de los casos se presentó en temporada de lluvias; este porcentaje considerablemente más alto con respecto al observado para los años 2009 a 2019, se relaciona, por una parte, con el comportamiento de la precipitación durante este año, donde la temporada de lluvia correspondió a los meses de febrero, marzo, junio, julio, septiembre, noviembre y diciembre.Con relación a los casos de Dengue, para el período comprendido entre el 2009 al 2020, se puede observar un aumento en la notificación de casos en el 2013 durante todo el año en comparación con el 2012, notificación que se mantuvo entre 2014-2015, aunque con una disminución no muy marcada. Esta disminución fue mucho más evidente en los años 2016-2017. Para el año 2018, se incrementó la notificación en un 26 % con 646 casos en comparación con los 478 casos en 2017, pero, un aumento no cercano a lo reportado en el período 2012-2015. Lo anterior, probablemente esta relacionado con el fenómeno de La Niña que ha venido presentando su comportamiento normal característico desde principios de noviembre 2017, aunque con un decaimiento de sus características atmosféricas típicas, debido en parte a una fuerte actividad intraestacional durante febrero, lo que llevó a condiciones neutras entre marzo y abril. Para 2019 y 2020 en concordancia con los casos notificados se refleja que otras oscilaciones climáticas han sido más significativas que el mismo ENOS sobre la precipitación en el centro del país; especialmente las asociadas a la intraestacionalidad, como la oscilación Madden & Julián; perturbaciones que influenciaron el comportamiento climático del país asociado a la debilidad del patrón de El Niño. Lo anterior podría influir en los patrones de transmisión del Dengue, por lo que se ven aumentos considerables en el número de casos notificados en los meses de mayo, julio y noviembre, y con la tendencia a un aumento considerable en comparación con años anteriores. De otra parte, los Fenómenos de Remoción en Masa (FRM) aumentaron en los meses con mayor precipitación, debido principalmente a condiciones estacionales (abril, mayo, octubre y noviembre), registrando los valores más altos en meses donde estuvo presente el fenómeno de La Niña (segundo semestre 2010, año 2011 y primer trimestre 2012).

The plan provides for the issuance of warnings about the onset of three levels of danger of heat and air pollution. Each hazard level has its own system of measures aimed at reducing the cumulative impact of heat and air pollution on public health.

This issue is taken into account by monitoring the implantation of tiger mosquitoes on the territory and actions to suppress larval gites. Innovations such as bioclimatic mosquito nets are also being tested and assessed in public buildings.For heat-related illnesses: The increase in heat wave episodes can weaken certain categories of the population.The Heat Wave Plan provides for prevention and warning measures that concern in particular the elderly, who are more vulnerable and often more isolated, as well as children and homeless people.  Registration on a file of isolated vulnerable people for monitoring during heat waves and other health risks. In addition, Parisians can search for cool places on Paris website . It lists more than 900 islands of coolness in Paris, whether permanent (gardens, municipal facilities ...) or temporary (foggers, exceptional openings of parks ...). For waters-born diseases: medical monitoring and risk prevention (vaccination against leptospirosis, taking into account the risk of heat, mosquitoes, rats, etc.) is deployed for agents working in high-risk professions (sewer workers, cleaning agents, park and gardens, etc.). In addition, a coordinated rat control plan is being implemented in Paris. For air-born diseases : the increase in temperature could also bring certain allergenic species to new regions (particularly for herbaceous plants that move more quickly), promote pollen production and make pollen more allergenic (increase in the quantities of allergens). The allergic risk associated with pollen exposure is monitored by the City and the National Aerobiological Monitoring Network (NAMN), and the results are communicated to the public and health professionals to help limit the health impact. In addition, the City's vegetalization policy takes into account the allergic risk in the choice of plant species planted.Concerning diseases related to air pollution: the 2017-2025 Air Protection Plan (APP) for Île-de-France was approved in 2018. It aims at reducing air pollution from all sectors of activity: air, agriculture, industry, residential and transportation. It particularly targets wood heating and road traffic, the main sources of fine particles and nitrogen dioxides in Ile-de-France. On the local level, several reference documents have been put in place by the City of Paris: The Parisian Health and Environment Plan (PPSE) to reduce health damage linked to the degradation of our environment, and the Paris' Climate Action Plan."

These include members of the community who are already vulnerable due to poor mental or physical health, the elderly, those who are isolated by a lack of mobility or transport options and/or are highly dependent on particular facilities or support. The risk factors and vulnerabilities for heat related illnesses also increase during a heatwave for those who work outdoors, can’t get access to cooling overnight, or who suffer mental illnesses and exacerbates Non-Communicable Disease Symptoms (e.g. respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, renal disease).  It is hard to specifically account for deaths and presentations to extreme heat or heatwaves, as these can impact existing medical conditions which is what they are presenting with.Low socioeconomic and rental householdsA barrier to keeping cool during extreme heat and heatwaves is the cost and ability to cool down your home. The cost of utilities to a household fluctuate seasonally and can cause bill shock if air-conditioning and water costs increase over summer in order to remain safe. Others might not turn on their air-conditioners or don’t have one, which may increase their risk-factors especially if elderly or with pre-existing health conditions.  53% of our population is renting – made up of 7.6% social housing and 44.9% private. Renters typically have a lower income and have limited ability to alter the thermal comfort of their home and lower bills – for example affording energy efficient technologies and upgrades. WildlifeIn 2010 the nationally threatened Grey-headed Flying-fox (GHFF) species established a campsite in the Adelaide Park Lands, one factor to their migration pattern could be climate change. Some flying foxes carry diseases, including Australian bat lyssavirus and the Hendra virus – which are only transmittable if a person is bitten or scratched. Temperatures higher than 42°C can kill the flying-foxes, and mass cleanups cause health hazards over multiple days – health hazards for the public at risk of coming into contact with them, and for the vaccinated workers and volunteers active in the days of extreme heat to rescue bats and clean up carcasses.  Over the 2019/20 summer season we had over 16 days of days over 40°C, and this is projected to increase. The CoA has worked extensively with partner organisations to developed management plans and practices to address the GHFF issue successfully.Air pollutionLike all cities the City of Adelaide we suffer from air quality issues associated with density of fuel-based transportation and other factors, including pollen, bushfires and dust.  Over the summer of 2020/21 various regions in South Australia including the Adelaide Hills, East of our region, experienced extreme bushfires which resulted in smoke blanketing the city on some days, and impacts workers who live or have to travel through these areas.  Mental healthThere has generally been an increase of mental health issues associated with ‘eco-anxiety’ or the state of the planet.  Mental health issues are and will continue to increase with the displacement and loss that surrounds natural disasters such as prolonged drought, floods and bushfires.Rough sleepers (Information accurate as of 31/05/2021)The City of Adelaide currently has 119 people sleeping rough and a further 76 in temporary accommodation. We know that approximately 72% of rough sleepers have physical health issues, the same percentage suffers from ill mental health and about 73% are struggling with substance abuse. Nearly half have a combination of all three (trimorbidity). This places them at much higher risk in extreme weather conditions than the general population with an often impaired capacity for appropriate self-care and less opportunity to shelter from the elements."

Enhancement in disease prevention: Cooperation between the diverse reporting channels for infectious diseases; enhancement in infection control inspection and guidance at hospitals; implement materials warehousing management and logistics control; development of pandemic-prevention human resources in communities and professional talent pipelines; establishment of disease monitoring mechanisms in communities for better monitoring and timely triggering of pandemic-prevention measures; formulation of disease prevention programs throughout the City for major infectious diseases such as influenza, dengue fever, tuberculosis and enterovirus; The information technology systems have been used to intelligently prevent and control infectious diseases, and contain the spread of infectious diseases through cross-bureau cooperation, while increase the coverage of various vaccines to give the effect of herd immunity.2. Prevention work - Dengue Fever(1) By 2020, we have recruited 98 medical institutions to participate in the promotion of “Implementation of Dengue Fever prevention network and community clinic fast screening and reporting program” in order to elevate the efficiency of advanced detection, earlier discovery and immediate treatment of the confirmed Dengue Fever cases.(2)We make use of technology to monitor vector mosquitoes and utilize the infectious disease prevention and control information integration system (GIS) to detect and collect community vector mosquito density survey indices in such high-risk areas (e.g., vacant houses, open spaces, markets, and the like) in communities and further provide  epidemic prevention personnel with infectious disease epidemic information and other related information, relevant geographical locations in combination with the relevant units including notably the Environmental Protection Bureau, the Department of Civil Affairs with prudent prevention and control measures.  As a natural result, we have virtually doubled prevention and control efficiency. (3)The Department of Environmental Protection continues to disinfect the entire City, including 456 community units once every 2-3 months and implement the prevention and control measures over dengue fever vector mosquitoes to strengthen inspections in an attempt to thoroughly eliminate possible breeding sources. During the period of 2020, we completed disinfection tasks in up to 2,410 community units, covering the total areas of 29.93 million m2, removed 3,748 containers with accumulated water in outdoor environments, removed 2,154 waste tires, satisfactorily completed 14,895 environmental inspections, issuing 181 reminder notices and 53 penalty tickets.(4) Through the cooperation with the National Mosquito-Borne Diseases Control Research Center of the National Health Research Institutes, the Taipei City Vector Mosquito Monitoring Center was organized by the Department of Environmental Protection in 2020. Start from April 2020, the survey and monitoring of vector mosquito density was carried out for 3 districts in residential areas and 3 districts in the residential areas near mountain. Since July 2020, another survey and monitoring of vector mosquito density has been carried out in commercial districts (Taipei Main Station and Nangang Station) and residential buildings near farmland.3. Prevention work - Novel Influenza A Virus Infections(1) Epidemic monitoring◆ It is required to execute a 10-day health tracking for the personnel vulnerable to avian influenza risks and the legally reported infectious cases. ◆ We established an unified contact window for the Department of Health and Animal Protection Office in order to exchange information immediately for the human influenza and the avian influenza. (2) Dissemination of health education◆ Urge all hospitals in the City to conduct more pro-active kind of TOCC examinations during the peak influenza period and execute stringent patient diversion and internal infection control measures. ◆ Disseminate the prevention and control of avian influenza, human being influenza and Novel Influenza A Virus Infections through diversified channels.◆ Train the epidemic prevention personnel to conduct the dissemination in communities◆ Distribute the single-sheet graphical file and the 30-character, 60-character and 90-character slogans to Level-1 agencies and their subordinate units and the key dissemination point will be “Eliminate avian influenza: 5 Yes and 6 No”.◆ Assign the health service centers deployed in the 12 administrative districts controlled by the Department of Health to disseminate the avian influenza prevention for schools, kindergartens and medical institutions."

If drought and mismanagement of water change the agricultural sector and ability to grow food there will be issues of food security – which typically affects those with lower incomes as food prices will increase. The impact for City of Adelaide is not specifically documented, and nor do we have a plan for addressing the issues of food security in a changing climate, or food security more generally.  However, we recently endorsed a Water Sensitive City plan which addresses issues of availability and using water in a water constrained future.

Although Maine is not expected to see the same extreme temperatures as other parts of the country, the impact of a high heat day or a heat wave has a very different impact depending on the region and time of the year. Unseasonably hot days, extreme heat, as well as extended heat waves can have a significant physiological impact on people whose bodies are less acclimated to warmer weather, which both affects people in historically cooler climates and makes extreme temperatures in the spring more deadly than those later in the summer. Likewise, air conditioning is much less prevalent in homes, businesses, and public spaces in Portland. Both due to human physiology and due to infrastructural cooling capacity, cities in cooler climates like Portland tend to see more heat-related deaths and hospitalizations. Health issues from extreme heat can lead to heat exhaustion, heat stroke, and hyperthermia. Prolonged exposure to heat also exacerbates asthma, heart disease, and diabetes, leading to more hospitalizations for kidney, cardiovascular, and respiratory disorders. A string of days that also have high minimum temperatures prevents bodies from being able to recover, amplifying the health risk. Residents who live and work in areas with more impervious surfaces and less green space will likely feel high heat more acutely. Areas with a significant portion of impervious surfaces, which includes many of Portland's socially vulnerable neighborhoods, will likely feel hotter due to higher surface temperatures. Residents who work in outdoor occupations, will have greater vulnerability to periods of high heat. Children, older adults, residents with disabilities, and residents without access to air conditioning will also be more vulnerable. There are fourteen vector-borne diseases of concern in the United States, and nine of those diseases (two mosquito-borne and seven tick-borne) have been identified in Maine. Lyme disease is the primary and most common vector-borne disease in Maine as of 2019. Symptoms for Lyme disease in humans usually include a fever, headache, fatigue, and a skin rash called erythema migraines. If left untreated, the infection can spread, resulting in chronic joint pain and neurological dysfunction. Changes in the climate, including warmer winters, higher humidity, and more precipitation, impact the breeding and survival rates of ticks and mosquitoes, as well as the reproductive rate of the pathogens. Rates of Lyme disease have increased significantly in the past couple decades from less than 100 reported cases in 2000 to 1,373 reported cases in 2018 (280 of which were in Portland's Cumberland County). Major storms, including associated heavy precipitation, high winds, and flooding, bring a wide range of health and safety risks. Most directly, these climate hazards lead to injuries and fatalities due to drowning; blunt injuries from falling objects or debris moving in floodwater currents; electrocution from exposure to electrical systems and electric shocks transmitted through flood waters; as well as vehicle accidents due to slick, eroded, or obstructed roadways. Impaired infrastructure and building damage can likewise lead to cascading health risks through loss or disruption in electricity/power, transportation, communication, and water and sanitation systems. All of these factors create heightened health risks, which can be amplified by an inability to access medical care, medical equipment, or medications. For example, compromised road and transportation systems restrict access for first responders, and limit access to medical care.  Loss of refrigeration—at residential, commercial, and industrial scales—also can compromise food safety and lead to foodborne illnesses. Likewise, waterborne illness is a major concern. A large number of studies now show that climate change will likely exacerbate poor air quality over time. Ozone at ground level can cause significant public health concerns by causing inflammation in the lungs. This inflammation leads to coughing and throat irritation in the short-term; over the long-term, lung tissues become less elastic, more sensitive to allergens, and more prone to infections—often leading to chronic conditions like asthma. Changes in meteorological factors such as higher humidity and stagnation could also lead to higher levels of particulate matter, which has shown to trigger cardiovascular problems The health effects of climate change are not only physical, but also mental and emotional. They stem from the immediate trauma from a local climate-related event; from the ongoing emotional toll of processing information about climate change and its consequences; and from stress induced by witnessing changes in the environment and a loss of a sense of place or identity."

The risk of cardiovascular problems, heat stroke, dehydration and hyperthermia is increasing. The elderly, the (chronically) sick and those in need of care, as well as pregnant women, infants and small children are particularly sensitive. Extreme events such as floods and severe storms can result in injuries and deaths. Such events can also have serious psychological consequences. A negative impact of heat waves on work productivity and sleep quality can affect the well-being of the entire population. The pollen season and thus the exposure time for allergy sufferers will be longer. People with pollen allergies are also particularly affected by the spread of invasive plants, such as the highly allergenic ragweed. The tiger mosquito and the Asian bush mosquito have already established themselves as new disease vectors. Ticks are also expected to continue spreading. While a decrease is expected for tick-borne encephalitis due to the heat sensitivity of the viruses, the risk of borreliosis remains. Other possible indirect effects on human health can be triggered by longer periods of drought, the changing rainfall regime and the floods. These altered hazards and effects can have an impact on the water regime and thus on drinking water quality."

These conditions will be worsened by climate change.  As a result, health issues caused by poor air quality and heat will become more frequent.  Intense rain events caused by climate change will increase flooding resulting in health impacts from mosquito borne diseases.  A longer breeding season for insects such as mosquitos will also have an impact on health.  These impacts will have an amplified impact on vulnerable communities as well as the elderly, the very young, and workers exposed to the elements.  Additionally, the City has also long been in a condition of non-attainment for air quality for ground level ozone.   Poor air quality has been correlated with reduced health outcomes, particularly to those with underlying health conditions, making them more susceptible to communicable disease.  The proposed air quality improvements necessary to mitigate climate change, will also help improve our public health."

Todos estes impactos à saúde poderão repercutir em gastos no sistema de atendimento público à saúde, assim como também poderá impactar o setor privado por conta do absenteísmo. A biodiversidade também sofrerá impactos e desequilíbrios que poderão culminar com a proliferação de determinados vetores (mosquitos e insetos). Atualmente, os bairros cujos índices de risco são considerados alto, em relação ao aumento da temperatura, destaca-se os bairros: Aeroporto, Álvaro Weyne, Bela Vista, Bonsucesso, Cais do Porto, Couto Fernandes, Cristo Redentor, Curió, Demócrito Rocha, Jacarecanga, Moura Brasil, Pirambú, Vicente Pinzón e Vila Ellery. Secas prolongadas: semelhante aos impactos estimados para o risco de aumento da temperatura, porém com o agravo da desidratação e desnutrição da população de maior vulnerabilidade.

Atualmente, os bairros cujos índices de risco são considerados alto, em relação ao aumento da temperatura, destaca-se os bairros: Aeroporto, Cais do Porto e Moura Brasil.Chuvas extremas: dentre os principais impactos à saúde, destaca-se as doenças hidricamente veiculadas cujos vetores se proliferam por meio das águas não drenadas em determinadas áreas urbanas. Sobre isso merece destaque o fato de que Fortaleza possui apenas uma pequena parte de seu território com cobertura de esgotamento sanitário, o que permite inferir que em períodos muito chuvosos, existe uma tendência de que as águas pluviais se misturam com os efluentes sanitários e escoem livremente pelas ruas, além de se infiltrarem no solo por todo o território, inclusive onde já existe rede regular de esgotamento sanitário. Atualmente, os bairros cujos índices de risco são considerados alto, em relação ao aumento da temperatura, destaca-se os bairros: Autran Nunes, Canindezinho, Cais do Porto, Couto Fernandes, Demócrito Rocha, Floresta, Granja Lisboa, Granja Portugal, Henrique Jorge, Genibaú, Quintino Cunha, Pici, Pirambú, Serrinha e Vicente Pinzón.Elevação do nível do mar: os impactos relacionados à saúde humana estão diretamente relacionais à emersão dos efluentes para a superfície, o carreamento de resíduos sólidos para o interior da cidade e à salinização das fontes de abastecimento, tanto dos poços, quanto da rede regular de abastecimento.

Lack of air conditioning increases risk of illness or death in extreme heat events, which pose the greatest risk to the elderly; people with mental illness, chronic conditions, or low incomes; people who are homeless or incarcerated; and those experiencing social or health-related vulnerabilities. Increased heat also intensifies the photochemical reactions that produce smog and ground level ozone and fine particulates (PM2.5), which contribute to and exacerbate respiratory disease in children and adults. Increased heat and carbon dioxide enhance the growth of plants that produce pollen, which are associated with allergies. Increased temperatures add to the heat load of buildings in urban areas and exacerbate existing urban heat islands adding to the risk of high ambient temperatures. In addition, violent crime has been shown to increase during heat events. All these impacts are likely to increase individuals' stress levels, potentially leading to mental health impacts.Drought, which is expected to occur more frequently with climate change, increases the risk of wildfires and reduces the amount of water available to fight wildfires. Climate change is also expected to cause fires to spread faster and burn more intensely in most vegetation types, particularly grassland. In addition to fire-related injuries, local and regional transport of smoke, ash, and fine particles increases respiratory and cardiovascular risks. Wildfires can also disrupt energy distribution, both directly by disrupting transmission lines and indirectly by causing utilities to shut down electricity distribution to avoid generating fire-starting sparks. Fire-associated power outages or shutdowns are life-threatening risks for residents who rely on electrically powered medical equipment such as respirators, and have already affected critical facilities including cooling centers, healthcare facilities, and assisted living facilities.Pandemics are expected to become more frequent as climate change continues to degrade natural habitats."

By the late century (2070 to 2099), this could further increase to sixteen days under the low emission scenario and thirty-two days under the high emission scenario. San Diego is projected to experience 0.6 to 1.4 more four-day heat waves per year by mid-century, and 1.2 to 4.2 more heat waves per year by late century. Frequency and duration of warm night is also projected to increase. Warm nights pose a health risk as they limit night time cooling and physiological recovery during heat waves and prolong the period over which heat-driven negative health outcomes can take place.The City used urban heat island index data from CalEPA to project areas that could be exposed to extreme heat. These data were the best available spatial information for heat within the City at the time of the vulnerability assessment. The geographic patterns revealed by CalEPA’s urban heat island data are likely to persist even as temperatures change over time. This source thus identifies areas of the City that are likely to be more or less vulnerable to future extreme heat events. In general, these data show thatareas near the coastline are cooler, and temperatures increase moving inland. The heat island scenarios are represented as zones with scores of 0 to 100+, with higher scores denoting hotter areas (CalEPA, 2019). A score of zero indicates that there is no difference in temperature over time between an urban Census tract and nearby upwind rural reference points. A score of 100 indicates that there is a difference of 7.5 degrees Fahrenheit (approx. 4.2 degrees Celsius) between these tracts over 24 hours."

For example, atypical influence of heat provokes cardiovascular disease or in cold weather when people are exposed to inadequate conditions, they suffer from frostbite. Changes in nature also affect the activity of some insects that transmit infections that are dangerous to humans, such as the prolongation of the tick season during warm spring and autumn, or the multiplication of ticks in warm winters. The Center for Disease Prevention and Control of Latvia (CDPC) provides annual monitoring of ticks and the collection of statistics on diseases caused by them, as well as regularly informs the public about tick activity, protection options and vaccination.

The unit operates a network of real time air quality monitoring stations, which reports directly to the South African Air Quality Information System (SAAQIS). Residents may visit the website to view the status of air quality in the city, at any given time. However the 4th station which belongs to the Dept of Enviro affairs, is situated at Northdale hospital and they are presently trying to get it back online due to some technical challenges. We have requested that the station be handed over to us, so that we can manage the station and analyze air quality data, which covers pollution in the Mountain Rise/Willowton areas. Some of the pollutants monitored are :-Sulphur dioxide (SO2)Carbon monoxide (CO)Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)Ozone(O3), Particulate Matter (PM) andVolatile organic compounds (VOC)In addition several meteorological parameters are also monitored at the monitoring stations. This unit has taken action against an industry located in PMB for a continuous petrochemical odour that has plagued the city for some time. A scientific Enose odour assessment was conducted during early 2021 as part of the ongoing investigations into the petro chemical odour being emitted by this industry. The matter is presently being heard in the high court.The Environmental Health unit continues to monitor air quality in the city of Pietermaritzburg and will not hesitate to take action against any other industry that is found to be flouting any public health legislation, including air quality legislation."

The risk for heat-related health impacts is highest amongst infants, young children, the elderly over 65, those already ill, athletes, those spending time outside, including outdoor workers, those engaging in physical activity, and those who don’t have access to air conditioning (Climate Central, “U.S. faces dramatic rise in extreme heat, humidity”, 2016), as well as those in more urban areas within the city, due an increase in the Urban Heat Island effect (Environmental Protection Agency & Center for Disease Control, 2016). Since 9.4% of Orlando’s residents are over the age of 65, 7.1% are under five years old, and one-in-five of all residents (20.2%) live at or below the poverty line, which is above average among the lower 48 states (U.S. Census Bureau, 2017), we have a large representation of groups are considered to be especially vulnerable to extreme heat. Furthermore, during dangerously hot days, the risk for these heat-related effects sharply increases and can reach even healthy young adults to middle-aged individuals. According to current predictions, annual heat-related deaths will increase to tens-of-thousands by the end of the century (Climate Central, “U.S. faces dramatic rise in extreme heat, humidity”, 2016), and, with the projections for our region, many of these deaths will occur in Central Florida. For individuals and families with pets that spend some or all of their time outside or do not have air conditioning, this also presents a serious risk (Florida Division of Emergency Management, 2013). These heat impacts may also provide a strain on the healthcare system when faced with increased hospitalizations and doctors’ visits, need for home care, and insurance claims. (Climate Central, “U.S. faces dramatic rise in extreme heat, humidity”, 2016).The impacts from high heat also interact with other climate hazards that can result in amplified risks. This elevated heat can contribute to stagnant air, which has been increasing in Central Florida, and allows dangerous levels of both air pollutants and ground-level ozone to build up in the local area (Climate Central, “Stagnant air on the rise, upping ozone risk”, 2016). The consequences include respiratory issues and increased risk of air-borne disease. Extreme heat can also compound drought conditions, elevated sink hole risks, and increased algae blooms and bacteria present in water (Climate Central, “U.S. faces dramatic rise in extreme heat, humidity”, 2016). Increases in extreme heat can lead to elevated hospitalizations, illness and death with a large segment of the population at risk. This danger is further elevated as an occupational hazard for those work outside, such as construction workers, crossing guards, athletes, landscaping professionals, groundskeepers, etc.Today, 1 in 3 American households struggle to afford their energy bills, and 1 in 5 are forced to decide between energy and other necessities (EIA RECS 2015).  In Orange County Florida, energy affordability threatens the 175,470 households living below 200% of the federal poverty level.  Cumulatively, these homes experienced a HEAG of $263.5 million in 2017 alone (Home Energy Affordability Report, 2018).  This equates to $1,501 per household in energy costs above the affordability threshold, roughly equal to the state average ($1,507). HEAG trends are severe in Florida, with a HEAG Index of 195.2 compared to the national average of 123.4. This reflects a doubling of the FL HEAG since the 2011 baseline.  As extreme heat patterns intensify, these trends can be anticipated to increase and threaten low income populations capacity to afford energy and other critical needs.  Residents who do not have easy access to air-conditioning, cannot afford to cool their homes regularly, who have homes without proper weatherization, or those who need to walk, bike, or take public transportation are all at higher risk to extreme heat, even before health and age are factored in.

Additionally, this risk may be even higher for the large number of visitors to Orlando who may be less familiar with the frequency and danger of lightning and the need to take shelter, even when storms are not directly overhead.These strikes can also result in damages and disruptions to services including electricity, phone lines, and internet connection based on local infrastructure, which may already be strained due to other storm elements, such as heavy winds, as well as commercial and residential property damage, and add to the risk of wildfires (as discussed in the corresponding section of this document).Increased lightning could result in injuries and fatalities, having an impact on victims’ and family members’ mental and physical health. Protective actions are also required for responders from hazards; personal protective equipment is required for emergency worker safety from downed utility lines, hazardous materials, and debris.Unfortunately, persistent myths and misconceptions, such as ""Lightning never strikes twice in the same place"", “Most people are struck by lightning on the golf course”, and ""Lightning rods prevent lightning strikes” contribute to accidents and injuries. With the current and rising threat of lightning, it is important to provide lightning safety information to residents and visitors to minimize harm to both humans and property."

Carbon monoxide poisoning can occur during or after the storm has passed if gas-powered generators are placed in an area without proper ventilation, as occurred during the series of Florida hurricanes in 2005. Additionally, populations sensitive to heat, such as the elderly, may be left without power for air conditioning for extended periods of time resulting in injury and fatalities, as tragically occurred in South Florida after Hurricane Irma (Fritz, 2017; Ochoa, 2017). Finally, foodborne illness can result due to lack of power for refrigeration, and water-borne illness from drinking or preparing food with water that has been contaminated from the strains on water reclamation facilities and other sources of water pollution (Florida Department of Health, 2015).Structural damages are also likely, including buildings (particularly roofing), signs, and other local infrastructure, such as roads, and the most powerful hurricanes can completely destroy many of these structures. Many individuals must evacuate or may require emergency shelter and assistance. Additionally, downed trees, limbs, and other debris can cause damage to electric and communication lines, and block access to roads. In addition to the cost for home repairs and needs pertinent to storm recovery, these impacts can have a detrimental effect on the local economy and may prevent businesses from operating for many months.There is a high possibility of injuries or casualties caused by somewhat preventable circumstances, such as, in the case of lost power: heeding warnings regarding food safety, monitoring water boil alerts, and following proper operating instructions for generators. experiencing these difficult conditions may undergo fatigue and distress. Responders are also at high risk of physical injuries or fatalities, as well and stress from hazardous conditions and conditions of their own family’s safety."

Illness may also result due to water contamination. Responders would also be at risk when responding to calls for assistance or rescue. There may be environmental impacts as well, as the local land ecosystem is flooded, environmental pollutants and hazardous substances wash into areas with the flood waters (Florida Division of Emergency Management, 2013) and wildlife, including snakes and alligators may be displaced (Hall, 2017). As many structures lie in the 100-year and 500-year floodplains, extensive property damage, as well as increased injuries, death, illness, and emotional distress among local residents and responders. It’s likely that business operations and economic activity may be disrupted during the event and often-lengthy repair period, as well as limitations for employees if the roadways are compromised or their automobile (or public transportation vehicles) have been damaged. There will be a significant impact on the insurance industry.There can be significant damage to transportation and utility infrastructure, government facilities, and other public structures. At a state-level, resources will be directed by Florida Division of Emergency Management to assist in local response and recovery efforts, which can cause a re-prioritization of the short- and medium-term government agenda, which can cause delays and limitations in government operations and delivery of services (Florida Division of Emergency Management, 2013)."

Extreme temperatures can put strains on the human body's thermoregulatory system, causing discomfort and danger to health. The main causes of hospital admission, resulting from excessive heat, are related to cardiovascular problems, changes in blood pressure and lack of cerebral oxygenation, breathing difficulties and kidney and liver failure. There are still few quantitative studies that analyze the effects of the urban heat island on human health in Portugal (Almeida et al. 2010). However, the city of Porto has shown a slight trend of temperature increase (Monteiro et al. 2012) and during the heat wave of July 2006, there were 107 more deaths than expected in the city of Porto (the which represented a 52% increase in the mortality rate) and morbidity from respiratory disease led to another 67 hospital admissions (Monteiro et al. 2013)."

Whether it is pollution from the highways that bisect these communities, or the storage and movement of fossil fuel-based goods in the port, the health of these communities suffer the most from this industry. For example, children living in the urban core of Rhode Island (Providence, Pawtucket, Central Falls and Woonsocket) experience higher asthma Emergency Department visit rates than the rest of the state. Children in low-income families are more likely to have severe asthma. In fact, 71% of all asthma-related emergency department visits in Rhode Island are for children in Medicaid. Geography in the city also matters. The east side has much lower rates of children living with asthma compared to the rest of the city and most emergency room visits related to asthma are in South Providence, Washington Park, Wanskuck, and the West End - all predominantly low-income communities of color."

People in areas with less tree canopy coverage and less access to air conditioning are highly vulnerable to increasing extreme heat and heat waves. Lower income neighborhoods and communities of color often have fewer trees, putting these communities at higher risk. Elderly people are very sensitive to heat, as are infants and people with existing health conditions. Higher temperatures can also increase the formation of ground-level ozone, a key component of smog. Ground level ozone causes many health impacts, including increased incidence of asthma and increased incidence of premature death from heart and lung disease.Severe thunderstorms are a major source of catastrophic loss. Severe storms can cause energy outages and  flooding. During energy outages, some of the most vulnerable populations include medically-sensitive populations and elders, because the loss of power can lead to exposure to extreme heat or cold, as well as failure of vital medical equipment. Flood waters often become contaminated with hazardous materials that can impact human health and contaminate drinking water. People most vulnerable to  flood impacts include those living in high  flood risk areas, and especially those with limited mobility, such as elders, homeless, and people without vehicles.With warmer and wetter winters, diseases such as mosquito-borne West Nile Virus, dengue, and Zika, as well as tick-borne Lyme disease, and Ehrlichiosis, could become more prevalent. Water-borne diseases, such as cryptosporidium, are strongly linked with increasing rainfall extremes such as those experienced in the region in recent years.A primary climate change vulnerability identified for Louisville Metro’s residents is the potential for an over-burdened healthcare industry tasked with responding to multiple or increasing threats of outbreaks and extreme events. State and local health agencies and vector control organizations are responsible for detecting and responding to diseases. Increasing capacity will be needed for continued tracking, diagnosing, and reporting of cases of known and new illnesses."

This report provided the assessment of the risk and vulnerability of the City of Tshwane’s residents to health impacts from heat for the current climate. This assessment provided a baseline assessment, which will be compared with future projections of climate change. This assessment used high-resolution exposure and vulnerability indicators to provide a spatially detailed risk assessment for the City. The exposure assessment considered two variables in order to unravel the potential risk to health from exposure to heat, namely, i) high maximum temperatures and ii) high minimum temperatures. These have a different spatial distribution in Tshwane, as they do in many cities due to the impact of UHI, and thus both needed to be considered when working to understand the risk to human health. The Vulnerability Assessment was comprised of three vulnerability indices that speak to the vulnerability of households (socio-economic vulnerability), the vulnerability of the infrastructure that supports them (settlement fabric vulnerability), and the vulnerability of the environment that supports these activities (environmental vulnerability). Vulnerability is thus the propensity or predisposition to be adversely affected by a hazard and is present within communities before they encounter a hazard. Socio-economic vulnerability (SEV) is a composite indicator that speaks to the vulnerability of households within a community. It is a composite indicator that addresses four indicators and seven variables including household composition (household size, age dependency), income composition (unemployment), education (literacy rates and level of education), and health (child mortality and comorbidities). A high vulnerability score indicates spatial areas with a high number of vulnerable households with regards to their ability to withstand adverse shocks from the external environment. The Socio-Economic Vulnerability Index shows that vulnerable pockets are distributed over all regions but is most notable in the following areas:•In the north-western part of Region 1•In the northern parts of Region 2•In the north to the centre of Region 3 and at its border with Region 4. •In the centre of Region 4, •where the northern border of Region 6 coincides with the southern border of Region 5. After combining the SEV with the population size in of each area, areas with the highest SEV are focused in the following areas:•In the central part of Region 1•At the border between Region 3 and 4 •In the southern part of Region 4, with the hot spot in the centre of Region 4 remaining. •In the northern part of Region 6 as well as •a few isolated areas in the north-west of Region 7.The aggregated effect of consecutive hot days and warm nights represents the worst exposure scenario to heat. The western and northern part of the CoT have the highest exposure to the combined effect of non-optimal temperatures. The following areas  are thus  considered risk hotspots for health impacts due to heat exposure and vulnerability before considering the effect of population size:•Regions 1 and 2 •Scattered areas in Region 5 and the northern parts of Region 3 and Region 6. When the population size of each hexagon is considered, heat-health risk hot spots are especially prevalent in the following areas:•Region 1 •the northern parts of Region 2 and Region 6 •with some isolated hot spots in Region 3, 4 and 7."

Although a sudden hazard - such as a heat wave - may increase instantaneous mortality and morbidity, the casualties may represent the tip of the iceberg of those adversely affected by climate change, and the underlying processes. Urban populations, especially in socially and economically disadvantaged areas, are likely to be particularly vulnerable to the unfavourable effects of climate change, due to already existing exposure to e.g. air pollutants, social stressors and the urban heat island effect and a higher burden of major chronic conditions. These populations are also likely to reside in areas with less urban green space and be less able to take adaptive actions, further increasing their vulnerability to heat effects and other weather-related stresses.City of Turku is collaborating with universities on a long-term basis to improve our understanding of the interaction between urban environment, climate, human health and adaptation, and how such phenomena transform spatially and temporally. In these studies, novel integration and analysis of longitudinal cohort data, socio-economic and policy data, environmental land cover data, and fine-resolution climate scenarios are utilized. Through the collaboration we will gain actionable knowledge to integrate climate-health risks in our strategic planning.During 2018 when the Turku Climate Plan 2029 was drafted, extensive studies on health-risks and vulnerability did not exist on national or local level. However, the situation has since improved. A national assessment on Weather and Climate Risks in Finland covering also health related risks and vulnerabilities was carried out in September 2018. The report contains an assessment of hydro-meteorological and climatic risks for different sectors in Finland.In addition, the Climate Change and Health Academy Programme (CLIHE) is investigating the impacts of climate change on human health and well-being in order to enhance the knowledge base for designing appropriate adaptation responses. CLIHE runs from 2020 to 2023 and comprises seven research consortium projects and three international joint research projects. Out of the seven projects Herkules-project examines past and possible future changes in pattern and intensity of climate-related health risks in six cities: Helsinki, Espoo, Tampere, Vantaa, Turku & Oulu, to develop a dynamic pathways model of different policy outcomes, and to catalyse chances for improved evidence-based decision making.Even if outcomes of CLIHE projects are not available in time for incorporation in the upcoming Risk and Vulnerabilities Assessment as part of the City of Turku Covenant of Mayors reporting and monitoring framework 2021, they can still make a concrete contribution to adaptation measures being implemented."

It has caused the saturation of hospitals and surpassed their capacity of attention; budgets have been topped due to a higher demand of patients and the needs special sanitation measures, which is increasing the costs of public and private services.Approximately 40% of the population has an informal job (about 60% are women) and receive attention in private hospitals; on the other hand, unemployed people are losing their access to social insurance. The loss of employment due to the lockdown has increased the requests of support to meet the most basic needs, which has had a direct effect on the budgets of government and private assistance organizations. The lockdown linked to COVID-19 has reduced the income from economic activities, which in return has affected the general access to basic services, mobility and the maintenance of private and public space; it has also produced an increase in the demand of telecommunication services and public services, which is about top the capacity of their providers."

El clima influye de forma importante en las enfermedades infecciosas y en sus diferentes modos de transmisión, siendo entre los alcances más trascendente el observado en las patologías transmitidas por vectores.En ese sentido, los escenarios futuros muestran una tendencia de cambios en la variabilidad climática, lo que prevé el incremento de plagas, así como la expansión de fronteras de vectores que se han visto favorecidos en su crecimiento por las condiciones agravadas de estos factores. A tales razones, el sector salud juega un rol primordial a fin de que la población pueda proporcionarse la información necesaria en materia de salud para su adaptación a los impactos del cambio climático y los fenómenos que ocasiona. Es de esperar que ante estas variabilidades se genere, en consecuencia, en un aumento en la presión del sistema público de salud. En lo referente a las patologías transmitidas por vectores, especialmente, las enfermedades arbovirales, aquellas transmitidas por el mosquito Aedes aegypti (incluyendo a la fiebre del dengue, chikungunya y Zika), se cuentan entre las de mayor relevancia para la salud pública (enfermedades sensibles a los cambios de temperatura y pluviosidad). Debido al pronunciado efecto que las alteraciones ambientales puedan ejercer sobre la biología de dicho vector, es probable que la epidemiología de esta arbovirosis se vea influenciada por el cambio climático y se intensifique. Ante este contexto, el sistema de salud pública de Rosario cuenta con una serie de instrumentos de gestión, protocolos de actuación, de prevención, de vigilancia y de control de enfermedades. Asimismo, dicho sistema desarrolla políticas públicas saludables y estrategias en función de los distintos escenarios según las características de la situación epidemiológica local y entomológica. Se llevan adelante diversas intervenciones, por un lado, algunas permanentes y sostenidas en el tiempo, las cuales tienen el propósito a la eliminación de los factores que permiten la instalación y continuidad de la enfermedad. Por otro lado, se realizan otras acciones abarcativas para situaciones de emergencias, que buscan limitar los brotes y minimizar las consecuencias sanitarias de la enfermedad, así como otras actuaciones de respuestas a emergencias sanitarias frente a los potenciales efectos que el cambio climático pueda generar sobre la salud de la población. Cabe señalar que en el ámbito de la salud pública de la ciudad se proyecta orientar las acciones para reforzar el sistema de salud ante el aumento de las precipitaciones y las temperaturas, a su vez, se prevé realizar una evaluación y seguimiento sobre los efectos del cambio climático en la salud pública. También se propone incrementar las capacitaciones al personal del equipo de salud respecto al cambio climático y sus repercusiones.Por su parte, en la ciudad se han realizado algunas investigaciones que relaciona los impactos del cambio climático en la salud, relacionado con el cáncer de piel y la propagación de enfermedades tropicales (mencionado anteriormente). Unos de los estudios técnicos que acompañaron el diseño de políticas de adaptación del proceso de planificación climática de este fenómeno global, fue el impacto del cambio climático en la salud (para mayor amplitud ver Anexo 6 del PLAC). Dicho estudio pronostica un incremento de la incidencia de cánceres de piel producido por exposición al sol y a la temperatura ambiente a lo largo del presente estudio."

However, the hospital, government, and public do not see this as a significant risk as they are experienced in managing extreme heat. Health impacts include heat exhaustion, dehydration, illness, and long-term heat related disease. Poorly adapted infrastructure is the main reason for vulnerability to this hazard. This includes modern structures with glass facades and non-traditionally Mediterranean design. Moroccan communities are known to live in social depravation with poor infrastructure and a lack of cooling technology. However, they are acknowledged to be well adapted to heat so the extent of impact is unclear. There is also a fairly large proportion of the population that fall under ""vulnerable populations"", such as children and elderly."

There have currently been no impacts from these fires as the likelihood of impact is highly reliant on prevailing wind patters. If a fire  occurs near the border in southern Spain and the wind direction favours Gibraltar, there would be impact from fire smoke causing air-pollution related illness. However, due to the small size of Gibraltar and its exposure to coastal weather, it is likely the smoke would continue to move off the coast quickly and would not stagnate in populated areas. Wild fires in the south of Spain are also a potential risk to health service provision in Gibraltar. Approximately 50% of the nursing staff in Gibraltar travel across the frontier every day to work. If a fire occurs near the border in southern Spain, this could prevent nursing/hospital staff from reaching the hospital. In this case, the hospital may become overwhelmed due to staff shortages.

Increased frequency and intensity of heatwaves are the greatest annual risk to Peterborough's vulnerable communities.  Prolonged heat waves can impact residents who do not have access to air conditioning or live in neighbourhoods without adequate tree canopy coverage that can lead to heat exhaustion.  Cooling centres are opened during heat waves and public amenities like splash pads, pools, and beaches are opened and staffed with lifeguards to support residents.  The City is also striving toward improving the urban tree canopy that will lower the ambient air temperatures of residential neighbourhoods by 2040. The surrounding rural and urban agricultural sector is at-risk during heat waves that can impact the health of agricultural workers. Untimely heat can disrupt growth cycles of plants or impart heat stress on animals that can reduce yields. This factor impacts the local economy and reduces the supplies of fresh produce and meat for residents who rely on locally produced food.  Flood and extreme rain events also pose a significant risk to the population if the onset is rapid and with little warning. To date, flooding has not led to a loss of life but is a possible outcome if someone was swept away due to rising waters or trapped in a car. The spread of Lyme disease increases the risk to residents when outdoors, especially indigenous populations practicing traditional cultural rites (i.e. gathering wildcrafted medicines)."

This creates increased risk to those who spend time outdoors.Extreme rain storms have led to widespread urban flooding and isolated riverine flooding putting residences, infrastructure, and municipal services at risk, including emergency response and health services, and present a risk of direct physical injury and death.Regional forest fires have led to increase in local smoke levels and reduced air quality, creating and exacerbating non-communicable respiratory health symptoms.Regional forest fires and flooding have also resulted in the city acting as a regional host for evacuees, many with complex health and social needs, creating additional strain on local health capacity."

Some of these are direct impacts such as the risk of heat stroke from extreme heat events. Others are indirect such as an increase in allergens due to an increase in the growing season for allergy causing plants. Since record keeping began in 1895, heat waves in Boulder County have become more frequent and intense. The continuance of this trend for increasing temperature trends is expected to lead to an increase in heat related deaths and illness. Extreme heat events compromise the body’s ability to regulate its temperature or by inducing direct or indirect health complications. The effect is especially notable on vulnerable populations including the very young, the elderly, and individuals with existing medical conditions."

Extreme heat days pose a public health threat, causing symptoms, such as, exhaustion, heat cramps, and sunstroke if the Heat Index is over 90 F.  Heat emergencies occur when residents are subject to heat exhaustion and heatstroke, and are more likely to occur in areas not adapted to heat and without air conditioning, cooling centers, or vegetation to mediate heat impacts in exposed areas. Certain populations are typically the most at risk during extreme heat emergencies, including people with disabilities, chronic diseases, the elderly, and children. Climate change is expected to generate an increase in ambient average air temperature, particularly in the summer. The frequency, intensity, and duration of extreme heat events and heat waves are also expected as regional climate impacts.The increase of extreme hot days will negatively impact our residents, especially our elderly residents and other vulnerable populations. Direct impacts of extreme heat include increases in heat-related illnesses such as heat-stroke, dehydration, and heat-related mortality such as heart disease. High temperatures can also exacerbate the impact of pre-existing conditions such as diabetes and renal disease. Higher temperatures and stagnant air also worsen Fremont's air quality and lead to higher rates of respiratory illness, asthma, and allergies. Indirect impacts of extreme heat include exacerbating behavioral health problems. The increase in heat-related hospitalizations and emergency room visits will strain the City’s health care infrastructure and affect care for all Fremont residents. Higher temperatures and increased duration of these high-temperature days will also lead to higher energy demands to cool homes and buildings, which will strain our resources and result in the use of highly polluting peaker plants to meet energy demands."

Wildland fires can cause damage to linear infrastructure systems that serve the Bay Area, causing outages downstream, can impact the air quality in cities during the duration of the fire, and can impact water quality in watersheds impacted by a wildland fire.  Wildland and wildland-urban interface fires can also damage natural environments, such as recreational areas, and can cause lasting impacts to slopes and soils. Wildfire risk increases due to climate change because of the experienced higher temperatures and longer dry periods, which result in longer fire seasons.  Additionally, wildfire risk will also be influenced by potential changes in vegetation. This lethal hazard has already been experienced on an alarming scale in neighboring communities and cities in California. California has also been hit by extreme heat and lightning storms that have ignited massive wildfires. In 2020 alone, 4.4 million acres were burned in CA wildfires, making air quality horrific throughout much of the State for months at a time. To date this year, another 450,000+ acres have been burned already,  and we are only in the beginning of wildfire season. With both the extreme heat events and wildfire risk, we have experienced rolling power outages over the past few weeks as the utility has struggled to meet cooling demands as well as has engaged in preventative ""Public Safety Power Shutdowns"" to reduce the risk of additional fire outbreak caused by sparking power lines."

According to the World Health Organization, while there is ""no evidence of a direct connection between climate change and the emergence or transmission of COVID-19 disease...climate change may indirectly affect the COVID-19 response, as it undermines environmental determinants of health, and places additional stress on health systems. More generally, most emerging infectious diseases, and almost all recent pandemics, originate in wildlife, and there is evidence that increasing human pressure on the natural environment may drive disease emergence. Strengthening health systems, improved surveillance of infectious disease in wildlife, livestock and humans, and greater protection of biodiversity and the natural environment, should reduce the risks of future outbreaks of other new diseases."" In Fremont and the surrounding region, health systems have been impacted by this pandemic, with delays in establishing virus and antibody testing sites, lack of availability of personal protective equipment (and the flooding of the market with untested/unapproved black market products) and reduced availability of hospital beds, especially in the early days of the outbreak. COVID-19 has had unprecedented impacts on the local and global economy, affecting public transportation systems, healthcare, food & agriculture, manufacturing, shipping, retail, travel, and recreation, and has most adversely affected disadvantaged/marginalized groups who have pre-existing medical conditions and/or who lack proper healthcare access."

Temperature rise and changes in precipitation patterns could increase water scarcity and subsequent incidence of water-borne diseases [WHO/UNEP, 2005]. Further impacts of climate change in the region include health and occupational risks associated with increased temperatures, increased frequency of vector-borne, air-borne and respiratory diseases, and nutrition and food insecurity. [Jordan INDC, 2015].In Jordan, under a high emissions scenario, heat-related deaths in the elderly (65+ years) are projected to increase to about 54 deaths per 100,000 by 2080 compared to the estimated baseline of under 3 deaths per 100,000 annually between 1961 and 1990.Conversely a rapid reduction in global emissions could limit heat-related deaths in the elderly to about 11 deaths per 100,000 by 2080. https://apps.who.int/iris/rest/bitstreams/1031234/retrieve"

The health hazards and adaptation strategies caused by it are mainly as follows:1.　Extreme temperature (high or low temperature): sudden drop in temperature or extreme high temperature affects the mortality of respiratory and cardiovascular related diseases.　(1) If the Central Meteorological Bureau forecasts that the temperature in Taiwan this week will exceed 36 degrees for 3 consecutive days or above 38 degrees. Publish together.　(2) Promote the treatment of high temperature and heat stroke and how to replenish water, and strengthen the promotion of prevention of heat injury and related climate.　(3) Provide health education and education related to the three highs and cardiovascular diseases, to provide the citizens of the city with the concept and knowledge of high temperature and low temperature prevention and health care.　(4) The five steps to promote methods to reduce exposure to high temperature and heatstroke treatment are implemented (the first five steps in order are shade, undressing, heat dissipation, and heatstroke treatment). Drink water, send to the doctor). The official Facebook fan page has a total of 15 In the second announcement, the number of posts reached about 10,000 people.2.　Air pollution: Air quality deterioration in Taichung City is divided into early warning and severe deterioration　(1)AQI>100During the deteriorating air quality period, through the web page marquee, the city government and the health bureau web page, the ""Healthy Satellite"" Facebook fan page, etc., publicize the public to take appropriate self-protection measures, and urge the catering industry to take appropriate measures to prevent oil fume.　(2)AQI>150 to AQI>300　　a. During the deteriorating air quality, through the web page marquee, the city government and the health bureau web page, promote the public to take appropriate self-protection measures, and promote the catering industry to take appropriate measures to prevent oil fume .　　b.

To prevent infection, drinking water should be fully boiled to avoid raw drinking. In addition, proper washing of hands with soap or hand washing milk before meals, after defecation and cooking food can also reduce the chance of infection. 4.　Dengue fever: climate change causes changes in temperature, rainfall, and humidity, which affect the ecology and life cycle of the vector. For example, the increase in the reproduction speed of the vector and the expansion of the distribution area will increase the risk of dengue fever, malaria and other related vector-borne infectious diseases. There are four major prevention measures :     (1) Blocking overseas: through international airport fever screening, intercept passengers suspected of being infected with dengue fever, and encourage people to take the initiative to seek medical treatment if they have suspected symptoms.     (2) Community epidemic prevention: Continue to monitor vector mosquitoes, strengthen community mobilization to improve the environment, and implement the prevention and treatment of confirmed cases, and conduct random checks on high-risk vegetable orchards.     (3) Medical integration: A total of 206 medical hospitals in this city have joined the Health Bureau's NS1 rapid screening reagents for screening, improving accessibility to the public, and encouraging medical personnel to proactively report suspected cases.     (4) Epidemic prevention education: A total of 13 education and training sessions were conducted for medical personnel, school nurses, travel agencies, agency companies, and foreign migrant employers, etc., and public health education was conducted through multiple channels to improve public self-protection and prevention awareness."

This has highlighted the need to have effective plans in place to mitigate the effects of cold weather on health.On average, there are around 25,000 excess winter deaths each year in England. Excess winter deaths (EWDs) are the observed total number of deaths in winter (December to March) compared to the average number of deaths over the rest of the year. Excess deaths are not just deaths of those who would have died anyway in the next few weeks or months due to illness or old age. There is strong evidence that many winter deaths are related to cold temperatures and living in cold homes, respiratory illnesses, and cardiovascular conditions as well as infectious diseases such as influenza. This is predominantly in older age groups, those with chronic illnesses and children. Heavy snow and ice has a small direct effect on health, predominantly as a result of falls and injuries.  Winter morbidity and mortality will likely remain an issue. Studies projecting future winter mortality suggest that the number of cold-related deaths will fall by about 2% by 2050, compared to 2000. Cold weather is expected to remain the biggest cause of weather related mortality in England for the foreseeable future.The five-year average Excess winter deaths index for Brighton & Hove for winters 2014/15 to 2018/19  was 21.4, equivalent to an average 144 Excess Winter Deaths per year. Brighton & Hove has an old housing stock with 66% of houses built before 1945 (compared with 43% across England) and many private sector properties labelled ‘hard to treat’ in relation to energy efficiency measures. In 2019, Brighton and Hove had an estimated 10.5% of households living in fuel poverty, equating to 13,723 households in the city.  Brighton and Hove has a Cold Weather Plan which is updated annually.The health, social, economic and environmental risks associated with a Severe Cold Weather spell have been assessed by the Sussex Local Resilience Forum (SRF) (Ref H18) and included on the Sussex Community Risk Register. There are a large number of council departments and external agencies that work together to prepare for and respond to cold weather events in Brighton & Hove. This include among others: Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals Trust; BHCC Health and Adult Social Care; BHCC Families, Children and Learning Directorate; BHCC Seafront team; IC24 (NHS Out of Hours Provider); City Clean; BHCC Emergency Planning and Resilience team; British Red Cross; Seasonal Influenza Programme.Together they coordinate a series of short- and long-term interventions to support vulnerable residents during cold weather. These include:•Cold weather sheltersBrighton and Hove City Council opens an emergency severe weather shelter in extreme weather conditions, known as Severe Weather Emergency Protocols. It provides shelter for all rough sleepers in the city and venues are made available to meet demand.  Further information:  https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/content/housing/homelessness-and-rough-sleepers/severe-weather-shelter-swep-faqs•Grants Warm Safe home grants (part of Disabled facilities grants) for insulation and larger measures•Advice and smaller measuresThe annual Warmth for Wellbeing programme funded by Public Health offers advice and support to vulnerable households to stay warm through the winter and save money on fuel bills. BHESCO (Brighton and Hove Energy Services Cooperative) provides outreach work to marginalised and isolated communities in Brighton and supports residents to save money on their energy bills, by giving energy efficiency advice, assisting with switching energy tariffs and installing small measures to help reduce energy bill costs throughout the year. Measures can include energy-saving LED lights, draught proofing and chimney balloons.Local advice providers provide advice on welfare benefits, debt and energy bills and can offer emergency grants to residents.LEAP (funded by Energy Companies Warm Homes Discount Industry Initiatives) offers eligible residents free home visits from a qualified Home Energy Advisor to help vulnerable residents save money and keep their home warm. They will:-Check energy tariffs and help with switching to save money-Install free, simple energy saving measures, such as lightbulbs and draught-proofing-Give practical advice on heating systems and saving energy-Arrange a free money advice consultation to help with benefits, debt and other money problems-Make referrals for additional energy-saving home improvements, such as loft insulation or a new boiler.Further details:  https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/news/2020/get-support-keep-your-home-warm•Transport measures The Council's Highways Winter Service Plan deals with interruptions to the transport network due to snow events, and ensures areas at risk of being isolated during snow events (e.g. Woodingdean) remain accessible."

There were three episodes of hot weather which met the standard Public Health England definition of heatwave in summer 2020 - all occurred in the South East.   •There are around 2,000 heat-related deaths per year in the UK •A range of mild to severe health impacts can result from exposure to high temperatures•There are specific heat-related health effects and illnesses including:oheat cramps, heat rash, heat oedema, heat syncope, heat exhaustion, heatstrokeoincreased numbers of admissions to hospital and consultations with GPs, and additional demands placed on emergency servicesofatalities, particularly among the vulnerable and older people•The main causes of illness and death during a heatwave are exacerbation of respiratory and cardiovascular illness.Severe and extended heatwaves can also cause severe disruption to general city infrastructure and public services like transport, waste collection, wastewater management, water distribution, energy provision and the health service  services. The number of visitors in the city of Brighton & Hove rises sharply in  the summer and during other major holidays. This can have an impact on the capacity of health services , especially during periods of intense heat.Going forwards, summers are expected to be up to 5 degrees hotter in the south east between 2061 and 2080, according to the Met Office's  UKCP18  predictions (metoffice.gov.uk). Hot spells will also become more frequent. The probability of exceeding 30ºC for more than 2 days rises from typically once every 4 years now, to about four times every year by 2070s. Environmental risk factors for increased exposure to heat include:Living in urban areas•This can be due to the urban heat island, poor access to green space and/or housing of a type that overheats •Dwelling types prone to overheating (such as south-facing top-floor flats)•1 in 5 homes in England are prone to overheating•Few (less than 3%) have air conditioning•Local air pollution (i.e. particulate matter) may exacerbate the health impacts"

High temperatures can also increase air pollution (ground level ozone and particulate matter) in the air which can exacerbate health impacts. Extreme weather events and flooding can also be detrimental to human health, with flooding in buildings leading to mould and damp and poor air quality. In addition to this, extreme events can trigger or exacerbate mental health issues such as depression and anxiety.  A survey was undertaken in 2019, commissioned by Public Health, called the B&NES Health Related Behaviour Survey 2019, locally referred to as the SHEU survey (as it is carried out by Exeter University,  Schools Health Education Unit).

A resposta reativa tem sido dada por vida dos sistemas de apoio à saúde e proteção dos cidadãos e em linha às solicitações por parte destes. A resposta passiva tem sido dada pelo planeamento e implementação de projeto que permita diminuir o efeito deste impacto.

At the national level, it is proposed to establish a bioprognosis system, in order to create a basis for a quantitative assessment of the impact of weather and climate on human health. There is a need to establish a bioprognosis system, as indicated by both direct (e.g. more frequent heat waves, floods, droughts, forest fires) and indirect indicators (increased frequency of food and waterborne diseases, allergic respiratory diseases caused by pollen, especially in children, more frequent occurrence of heart attack and stroke during low air pressure, large temperature fluctuations, as well as steamy hot days). The idea is that in order to prevent and adapt to changed climatic conditions, with the help of a biometeorological forecasting system, a database on the impact of weather and climate on human illness and death is being formed. Two directions of data collection have been defined: through questionnaires with meteorological reactions and through a list of specific diseases that can be affected by weather conditions. In order to inform the public and raise public awareness of the impact of heat waves on the health of the general population and vulnerable groups (children, the elderly, the chronically ills, and pregnant women), have is organized campaigns and distribution of propaganda material which conten recommendations for protecting the elderly from extreme heat. Some types of impacts are increased temperature (increased transmission of diseases through food, such as salmonella infection and transmission of vector-borne diseases such as tick-borne encephalitis, Lyme disease, leishmaniasis); floods (direct physical effects - drowning and injuries, welfare effects (e.g. mental illness due to floods and displacement), potentially increased risk of food and waterborne diseases); extreme temperatures (increase in mortality rate due to heat waves and extremely low temperatures). Adaptation measures in the health sector should focus on strengthening existing institutional capacities, disseminating information and monitoring systems to better understand the impact of climate change on human health."

Las Islas de Calor, al igual que las superficies calientes en las zonas urbanas calientan el aire ambiente, también transfieren calor a las aguas pluviales. Los distritos de Concepción, San Juan, San Diego y Tres Ríos presentan importantes islas de calor las cuales en la figura corresponde al color más intenso y a las regiones con mayor desarrollo de infraestructura gris. El distrito con el mayor rango de variación es San Rafael y el distrito con la mayor temperatura superficial del terreno es San Juan y los distritos con menor cantidad de islas de calor son Dulce Nombre y San Ramón.El calor urbano ya está afectando a la salud humana, al tiempo que pueden incidir en el consumo de la energía y la contaminación ambiental. La reducción de las islas de calor urbano puede tanto mitigar el cambio climático (reducir las emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero) como adaptarse al cambio climático (prepararse para los impactos inevitables del cambio climático). La exposición a altas temperaturas puede provocar insolación, agotamiento por calor, calambres por calor, sarpullido por calor y malestar general. La gravedad de las enfermedades relacionadas con el calor también aumenta con la edad: ""Los calambres por calor en una persona de 17 años pueden ser un agotamiento por calor en una persona de 40 años y un golpe de calor en una persona mayor de 60"" .Las personas de edad con ingresos fijos, junto con otras personas de bajos ingresos, tienen menos capacidad para pagar el recibo por energía eléctrica que por lo general aumenta por el uso de ventiladores o aires acondicionados  para contrarrestar el calor, lo que las hace más vulnerables. Los lactantes, los niños y los residentes socialmente aislados corren un riesgo especial de sucumbir a las enfermedades relacionadas con el calor. Los trabajadores a la intemperie, los discapacitados mentales, las personas sin hogar y los que padecen ciertas afecciones crónicas también son más vulnerables al calor que el residente medio.Las islas de calor también dañan la salud pública al disminuir la calidad del aire. La combinación del aumento de la contaminación y las temperaturas más altas da lugar a más smog (ozono a nivel del suelo). El smog agrava las enfermedades respiratorias como el asma, que son más frecuentes entre los mismos grupos que ya son vulnerables a las enfermedades relacionadas con el calor: los ancianos, los niños pequeños, los pobres y las personas con enfermedades crónicas preexistentes . Además, las islas de calor pueden reducir la calidad del agua mediante la contaminación térmica. Al igual que las superficies calientes en las zonas urbanas calientan el aire ambiente, también transfieren calor a las aguas pluviales.Pequeños o grandes cambios en el clima urbano tienen consecuencias directas o indirectas para los ecosistemas, la biodiversidad y los servicios ecosistémicos fundamentales que prestan a la salud y el bienestar humano de sus habitantes. Los ecosistemas urbanos y la diversidad biológica desempeñan un papel cada vez más importante en la ayuda a las ciudades para que se adapten al cambio climático. El aprovechamiento de la biodiversidad y los ecosistemas urbanos como soluciones de adaptación y mitigación ayudará a lograr resultados más resistentes, sostenibles y habitables."

Para el caso de Metepec, las inundaciones son un evento asociado a los escurrimientos fluviales procedentes, en más del 95%, de la ladera Este del Nevado de Toluca. Es así como en el municipio las inundaciones que se presentan son principalmente del tipo fluvial, seguidas por algunas (que representan más bien encharcamientos) de tipo pluvial en los puntos deprimidos del norte del municipio en relación directa con las fallas en el drenaje de la red municipal, éstas asociadas en la mayor parte de los casos a acumulación de basura en alcantarillas y drenes. Así pues, para el municipio de Metepec se tienen identificados las siguientes zonas de riesgo: • Inundación por lluvias intensas sobre áreas planas (acumulación, al sur del municipio). • Encharcamiento por deficiencias de drenaje superficial (Tollocan, Las Torres, etc.). • Desbordamiento de corrientes naturales y de ciénagas (San Lucas Tunco). • Obstáculos al flujo por la construcción de obras civiles. • Crecidas repentinas por cauces de respuesta rápida (río El Arenal)  Una vez que se identificaron los sectores más afectados en su funcionalidad dado un impacto procedió a hacer un análisis sobre la capacidad de adaptación de estos sectores. Con información del municipio y asesoría técnica se encontró a manera de resumen lo siguiente: • El sector con mayor capacidad de adaptación cuando un impacto de inundación, desbordamiento de canales - afluentes o sobresaturación de redes de drenajes se presenta; es el Urbano (vivienda y equipamiento) y el de comunicaciones y trasportes. •  Por otra parte, el sector que menor capacidad de adaptación cuando el mismo impacto se presenta es el agropecuario y desechos.  El riesgo se calculó a partir de la información presentada en el Atlas de Riesgo del municipio de Metepec (2015), respecto a los fenómenos hidro meteorológicos; identificando la vulnerabilidad de todos los sectores, dado un impacto determinado y multiplicado por el rango de probabilidad, de que una amenaza produzca dicho impacto. Los resultados fueron compilados en la siguiente tabla y la cual muestra que, para el municipio de Metepec, los impactos referentes a inundaciones, encharcamientos, desbordamiento de canales – arroyos y bajas temperaturas se presentan con alto riesgo.

Various studies on DHF in the area have verified that is an epidemic in Tarakan City. This is due to the lack of clean water access, which forced the community to use rainwater openly, causing mosquitoes to grow feely. The open water reservoir became a place for it to breed, increasing the risk of dengue fever. The anti-dengue cover nets, usually referred to as Topi Anti DBD were used to cover the water reservoir. This net is a cover for water containers that prevent s the mosquitoes from breeding in the water. It is made of perforated mesh fabric with a tiny diameter to reduce the risk of contamination of the water by mosquitoes. TAD was also designed with pores that can accommodate rainwater harvesting. The acronym TAD was suggested by the Tarakan Health Office to help people remember it easily. The additional, the communities of 29 RTs in Kelurahan Selumit Pantai were trained and assisted in making their own TAD's by using a simple sewing machine."

The production and consumption of food can have an impact on climate change. For example, by-products of food waste include the energy and water it takes to grow, harvest, transport, and package it, but food that goes to the landfill also rots which releases harmful gasses including methane.Ensuring that the food system across County Durham focuses on supporting health and well-being, sustainability, climate change, and food waste is very important in supporting the food environment for the future. Cutting down on salt, red and processed meats, and saturated fats, while increasing intake of fruit, whole-grains, nuts, seeds, and vegetables, is likely to have wide-ranging health benefits. Diets high in salt and saturated fat, but low in fish, fruit, vegetable, and fibre increase the risk of high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, and some cancers.Consuming foods and drinks that are high in fat and non-milk extrinsic sugars (NMES - often referred to as added sugars but also including sugars in fruit juice and honey) too frequently can contribute to excess energy intake and weight gain. Excess weight and obesity carry many negative effects on health. The effort to increase the health benefits of our food by avoiding foods such as red meat, we are also reducing the carbon footprint of our diets. Similarly, reducing the likelihood of food scarcity by supporting local suppliers will reduce the carbon factor associated with our food miles."

Climate change creates and heightens health and safety concerns for the public and for City staff and contractors. The City of Fredericton will do its part to maintain health and safety for its staff and for the public in the roles it previously has played, such as providing access to emergency services and providing updates on safety risks associated with flooding and extreme weather events. The City will work to enhance its services in these areas, including increasing communications and helping citizens to prepare themselves in advance of extreme weather.Below are some examples of how climate change may impact community health or the health system of our City:- Lyme disease is expected to become more prevalent as longer, hotter summers and more mild winters increase the ticks’ rates of survival, growth and reproduction.- Climate change increases risk to mental and physical health and vulnerable populations may experience heightened risks in these areas.- Extreme heat can compound issues during emergency calls, including the exasperation of heath and mental health issues. Increases in frequency and duration of periods of extreme heat leads to increased health and safety risks for the public, especially vulnerable populations due to their limited ability to prepare for and cope with such events. There is expected to be more calls for service that could overwhelm emergency response. The combination of heat stress and poor air quality can pose a major health risk to vulnerable groups: young children, elderly, , economically disadvantaged, and those with preexisting health conditions.- Extreme weather events will lead to an increase in power outages and associated health and safety risks relating to lack of traffic signals, unsafe food preparation, unsafe heating practices, and lack of indoor heating and cooling.- Wildfires threaten lives directly and can cause health impacts, particularly respiratory impacts, from inhalation of particle pollution. Fires spread air pollution not only nearby, but thousands of kilometres away—causing breathing difficulties in even healthy individuals, but especially in children, older adults and those with heart disease, diabetes, asthma, COPD and other lung diseases."

These events result in increased hospital admissions for heat- related illness, as well as cardiovascular and respiratory disorders. -Extreme heat events can trigger a variety of heat stress conditions, such as heat stroke. Heat stroke is the most serious heat-related disorder. It occurs when the body becomes unable to control its temperature. Body temperature rises rapidly, the sweating mechanism fails, and the body cannot cool down. This condition can cause death or permanent disability if emergency treatment is not given. Small children, the elderly, and certain other groups including people with chronic diseases, low-income populations, and outdoor workers have higher risk for heat-related illness; -Higher temperatures and respiratory problems are also linked. One reason is because higher temperatures contribute to the build-up of harmful air pollutants;-One of the most important effects of climate change in Palestine is shortage of water. One of the adaptation measures to cope with water shortage includes reuse of grey or treated wastewater in irrigation of trees or vegetables; this could increase the opportunity for transmission risk of several pathogens through crop contamination with pathogens that could cause outbreaks like Typhoid fever or Hepatitis A if the water is not well treated; -In addition, rising temperature due to climate change will increase microorganisms’ growth; leading to increases in water and food-borne diseases, in contrast flooding which is a result of extreme rainfall through concentrating the annual rainfall in a small interval lead to disruption of water purification and contamination with sewage disposal systems, leading to increase the probability of epidemics due to vector borne “VBDs,” water and food-borne diseases;1-Climate change may also influence the seasonal pattern for respiratory diseases, cardiovascular diseases and mortality. The most visible effect of climate change on respiratory diseases is on chronic respiratory diseases including bronchial asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases “COPD”; acute infectious respiratory diseases seems that are not going to be directly affected;-The sensitivity of the health sector in Palestine is directly or indirectly affected by climate change. The influence scale ranged from insignificant (malnutrition) to catastrophic emerging epidemics (haemorrhagic fevers). Young children and elderly are the most sensitive group mainly to foodborne and waterborne diseases where the admission rate will be increased followed by respiratory diseases where the admission rate and mortality rate will be increased.-The increased temperature resulted from climate change will increase the frequency of days with unhealthy levels of ground-level ozone, which is a harmful air pollutant and a component in smog that results in damaging lung tissue, reduce lungs functioning and results in premature deaths."

Certain meteorological conditions lead to a build up in toxins in the air we breathe (particulates and nitrogen dioxide being the two predominant toxins).  The two major physical impacts from particulates are on the respiratory and cardiovascular systems, and there is emerging evidence that there may be links to degenerative neurological conditions such as dementia.   It is estimated that between 28,000-36,000 deaths in the UK annually are linked to poor air quality.  The cost of this in England between 2017 and 2025 is estimated to be as high as £5.56 billion.The West Midlands, being predominantly urban, also suffers from the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect.  Research from the 2003 heat wave shows that the region had an estimated 90-130 excess deaths during this period.   The UHI effect pushed average temperatures 3°C higher than the neighbouring rural areas.   It is suggested that the UHI  contributed up to 52%  of heat related mortality.  During the 2003 heatwave, ambulance call outs in Birmingham increased by a third.  Those in sub-standard housing, the elderly, and those from a lower socio-economic background are less likely to be able to adapt to these hot days, and are therefore more susceptible to illness during these periods.   In addition, those with disabilities and pre-existing medical conditions are at a greater risk of complications arising from heat stress.The transport network is also susceptible to disruption during hot weather, for example, railways often have to run at reduced speed."

Combined with climate change there is likely to be an increased level of impact on health outcomes and on the capacity of the health system to cope.There are already (anecdotally) an increased number of people suffering from climate-related anxiety, and as awareness increases and local effects begin to be felt this may increase, though hopefully increasingly visible climate action may mitigate some of this. Increased summer temperatures and risk of heatwaves has the potential to cause greater public health risks as our buildings and urban areas are not designed to cope with these. It also poses a risk to food security and increases potential for pest species.5% of deaths in the former Taunton Deane Borough Council area were estimated to be caused by long-term exposure to man-made particulate air pollution (see https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/estimating-local-mortality-burdens-associated-with-particulate-air-pollution). Climate action should help address this issue.Increased flood risk carries increased risk to life and potential for water-bourne diseases as well as creating concerns about food security."

These include members of the community who are already vulnerable due to poor mental or physical health, the elderly, those who are isolated by a lack of mobility or transport options and/or are highly dependent on particular facilities or support. The risk factors and vulnerabilities for heat related illnesses also increase during a heatwave for those who work outdoors, can’t get access to cooling overnight, or who suffer mental illnesses and exacerbates Non-Communicable Disease Symptoms (e.g. respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, renal disease).It is hard to specifically account for deaths and presentations to extreme heat or heatwaves, as these can impact existing medical conditions which is what they are presenting with. A barrier to keeping cool during extreme heat and heatwaves is the cost and ability to cool down your home.The cost of utilities to a household fluctuate seasonally and can cause bill shock if air-conditioning and water costs increase over summer in order to remain safe. Others might not turn on their air-conditioners or don’t have one, which may increase their risk-factors especially if elderly or with pre-existing health conditions. Over the 2019/20 summer season we had over 16 days of days over 40°C, and this is projected to increase.Over the summer of 2020/21 various regions in South Australia including the Adelaide Hills, East of our region, experienced extreme bushfires which resulted in smoke blanketing the city on some days, and impacts workers who live or have to travel through these areas. There has generally been an increase of mental health issues associated with ‘eco-anxiety’ or the state of the planet. Mental health issues are and will continue to increase with the displacement and loss that surrounds natural disasters such as prolonged drought, floods and bushfires."

Concerns that will need to be investigated include for our health system include: • Future proofing hospitals to filter out smoke • Increasing messaging to more vulnerable members of community and workforces • Message fatigue - the need to communicate simply about a vast range of health topics means we don’t always hit the mark or people don’t notice it anymore"

Already there are a lot of people experiencing food security issues due to low-income and a range of other factors. These issues will be exacerbated by climate change. If drought and mismanagement of water change the agricultural sector and ability to grow food there will be issues of food security – which typically affects those with lower incomes as food prices will increase. The City of Unley has a multi-year grant for a community volunteer group actively working on promoting growing more food at home and providing free workshops to the community to help supplement food security.  In 2016 SA experienced a state-wide blackout due to extreme storms knocking over an important interconnector. This spurred action regarding energy security, safety, transport, and indeed healthcare to become energy sufficient. Another area potentially impacted that will link back to health, is potential risk from flooding on ability of the City of Unley to conduct its waste management services and collect general waste from its residents in a timely manner. If prolonged depending on future scenarios, this could increase disease and mental health risks."

A Public Health professional sits on our internal Climate Change Steering Group. As outlined in response to question 2.1, Climate Change can be expected to have a number of impacts on health. This includes direct health outcomes, such as an increase in excess mortality where there is extremely hot weather, and an increase in vector borne and water borne diseases as the climate changes and flooding becomes a more significant issue.Climate Change will also impact on health systems, as we may see an increase in demand for resources and pressure on infrastructure both from this extra demand and from extreme weather events/damage to infrastructure. Finally, areas that are not directly related to Public Health, such as food availability, and the quality of the built environment, will have a knock-on impact on the health of our population.The council recognises that there are serious impacts on health as a result of climate change. We’ve touched on some of these known health risks and have highlighted improved health as a co-benefit of certain actions.  We held a public sector business breakfast in June 2021 bringing together public sector leaders to discuss the actions they can take, and how the public sector can work together and with local people to tackle climate change. This included representatives from health partners such as St George’s Hospital Trust and South West London Mental Health Trust and discussed all aspects of climate change. The group will continue to meet regularly to identify common goals and collaborate."

De allí específicamente se menciona diarrea, asma, alergias, más en la población de mayor vulnerabilidad por su estatus económico o edad ( niños o tercera edad).Se nota además dentro del área de salud lo relacionado a la condición emocional, la cual afecta el normal estado de salud de las personas que se ven afectados económicamente, porque se dedican a la actividad agropecuaria y el cambio climático no los favorece. Al hablar de actividades económicas del sector agropecuario podemos mencionar aquellas relacionadas a la cría de animales y a la producción de plantaciones como granos, raíces y tubérculos (el cual constituye el principal siembro en esta región). Dentro de la salud emocional se resalta la emoción directa de las personas que sienten el calor excesivo que se percibe en este distrito y aquellas personas de muy escasos recursos económicos que las lluvias en exceso les ocasiona problemas por el mal estado de sus viviendas.Otro aspecto fundamental presenta una relación de causa efecto con la variable independiente clima, es la nutrición y la seguridad alimentaria, sobre todo en cuanto que la producción, principalmente en esta municipalidad, representa el pilar fundamental del sostenimiento económico de los habitantes, razón por lo cual la inestabilidad climática influye en la actividad principal que desarrolla el ocueño (gentilicio) común. Esta relación causal crea una dependencia entre los objetos clima y producción, hasta de manera predictiva e hipotética decir que entre más estable la manifestación climática predecible mejor la producción que se obtiene en la región. Este proceso ordinario de motivo y consecuencia (causa- efecto) se convierte en el proceso fijo que garantice la seguridad alimentaria, de Ocú y lo que se envía a nivel nacional y la exportación a otros países. Ocú es uno de los mayores productores de raíces y tubérculos de Panamá, lo que evidencia su vigilancia por la estabilidad climática que le ayude a la producción que es el sostenimiento económico.En relación a los servicios básicos los cuales ciertamente nos llevan a ver su cercanía a la salud de la población se puede señalar que el servicio del agua que se consume presenta situaciones problemáticas al momento de su escases en la época seca del estado atmosférico de nuestro país. Al no contar con agua potable en los hogares da lugar a la falta de aseo que genera la introducción de vírus y enfermedades que sacude a las familias.La cabecera del distrito, es el corregimiento (unidades con gobierno local que se desprende del municipio), que mayor población contiene en el distrito, el cual no cuenta con un alcantarillado, lo que ha ocasionado que por muchos años exista problemas en el destino de agua residuales, que genera contaminación a fuentes de agua y los malos olores. En este momento existe intención positiva de parte del gobierno central para la construcción de un alcantarillado. De darse este proyecto la participación del departamento de gestión ambiental del  municipio tendrá una participación directa que garantice que exista acciones que no perjudiquen el ambiente natural  de la comunidad. Se hace necesario que este proyecto se efectúe por la salud de las personas y el bienestar ambiental general de la municipalidad.Se resalta que una de las principal finalidad de establecer un proyecto macro de conservación o mejoramiento en el cambio climático es salvaguardar la salud de los pobladores, por ello que para esta región, la cual representamos como institución de gobierno local se debe trabajar colectivamente en garantizar:- Un ambiente natural agradable a la población- Infraestructuras amigables que permitan la ejercitación física y mental de las personas.-Acercamiento constante a los productores para que sus actividades sean científicas y en consecuencia sana con el ambiente.-Vigilante como gobierno local para que las construcciones civiles públicas privadas cumplan con los indicadores de la conservación.-Implementar estrategias coordinadas con el Pacto Global, inventario, actividades de mitigación, reducción de riesgo, resiliencia en la comunidad,"

Por otro lado, Renca es considerada la 30° comuna de “media baja prioridad social” entre un total de 52 comunas de la Región Metropolitana, esto según el Índice de Prioridad Social (IPS) elaborado por la Secretaría Regional Ministerial de Desarrollo Social del año 2019.Según Censo 2017 significaba que Renca pasó de tener 35,49 adultos mayores por cada 100 menores de 15 años a tener 63,66 adultos mayores por cada 100 menores de 15 años. Sin duda un aumento sostenido que refuerza el hecho que la población de la comuna de Renca, en promedio ha ido progresivamente envejeciendo en los últimos 15 años.  Según Naciones Unidas, una población envejecida es aquella en la que, del total de sus habitantes, más de un 7% son personas mayores de 65 años. De acuerdo a ello, ya Renca en el 2017 tiene una población envejecida de un 10%, lo que trae consigo, un incremento de las demandas en razón a las necesidades de este grupo etario altamente vulnerable, fundamentalmente de salud, económicas y sociales.Durante esta pandemia, la atención primaria de salud ha desempeñado un rol fundamental en el cuidado de las personas que contrajeron el virus y sus familiares. La abrupta y elevada demanda de atención sanitaria, sumada al desconocimiento del comportamiento de la enfermedad sobrepasó la capacidad de respuesta de la red de atención secundaria, dejando al descubierto la vulnerabilidad del acceso a la salud de la población general. A pesar de que la APS tiene como objetivo desarrollar acciones promocionales y preventivas, los equipos de salud debieron transformar su funcionamiento habitual para entregar una atención oportuna a todos los usuarios contagiados que no tuvieron acceso a una atención en la red de atención hospitalaria. Esta respuesta tan necesaria para las personas, fue del funcionamiento de los programas preventivos de los centros de salud, así mismo las actividades promocionales fueron relegadas para disponer del recurso humano e infraestructura para la atención de las personas contagiadas.Sobre las patologías respiratorias en población infantil, el año 2019, se observa un 31% de disminución de este tipo de consulta lo que está asociado a mejoras en la prevención y una buena cobertura de la vacunación anti-influenza que muestra una diferencia respecto del año 2018. Respecto a las consultas de morbilidad registradas a septiembre del 2020, también se han visto afectadas por motivos de emergencia sanitaria, ya que en el tercer trimestre de este año sólo han consultado un 3,13% respecto al año anterior, lo que dificulta estimar adecuadamente los cambos en relación a los indices de contaminación atmosferica. Del total de consultas de morbilidad de los CESFAM, el 22.3 % corresponde a adultos mayores . Mientras que la tasa de consulta de morbilidad en el adulto mayor es de un 1,4 del total de consultas de morbilidad. Los desafíos que los equipos de salud se habían proyectado para el año 2020 en orden de ampliar y aumentar la cobertura de prestaciones para las personas mayores, especialmente en el ámbito preventivo como es el EMPAM, se vio bruscamente suspendido debido al estado de pandemia por SARS-COV-2 declarada a nivel mundial en el mes de marzo.Considerando que el grupo de personas mayores es el grupo más vulnerable a complicarse al contraer COVID-19 debido a su mayor carga de patologías crónicas y la fragilidad, es que las autoridades sanitarias declararon que los mayores de 75 años debían permanecer en sus hogares. Así mismo con el fin de optimizar los recursos humanos y económicos para abordar el estado de pandemia se debieron priorizar las atenciones de pacientes contagiados y sus contactos teniendo que postergar los controles de salud de la población.Es así como los exámenes preventivos de salud (EMPAM), y los controles de patología cardiovasculares han sido postergados hasta contar con las medidas de seguridad y recursos suficientes para poder dar respuesta a esta atención.Desde el mes de agosto los equipos de salud han comenzado a controlar a los usuarios mayores de 75 años del programa cardiovascular en sus domicilios bajo el programa Red de Protección “75+”, considerando que es la población más frágil y susceptible de complicarse o morir frente a el contagio por COVID-19.
