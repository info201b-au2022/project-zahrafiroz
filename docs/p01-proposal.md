#### Data Relation to Problem Domain and Research Questions:

Our dataset is composed of data on the human health impacts of climate, climate-related disaster frequency, city climate hazards, and data on governmental expenditures on environmental protection and climate change action. This data is directly related to our problem domain of climate-change and human health, and will allow us to answer each of our three research questions. Specifically, the data we gathered on the reported effects of climate change on human health, the main climate hazards present in major cities, and our data on the frequency of climate-related disasters will enable us to answer our first research question which is concerned with what the main effects of climate change on human health are. In this case, we will use the frequencies of this data to compute the dominant effects. Next, by comparing the frequency and location of climate hazards, climate-related disasters, climate related health impacts, and governmental expenditures on environmental protection we will be able to answer our second question on which groups are most affected by climate change health issues by finding the groups most represented across the different data files. Finally, after finding the groups most affected by climate change related health issues, we will be able to compare the groups with governmental expenditures to determine how the governments of those most affected by climate change have responded to their citizens’ growing health issues.

#### Data Provenance:
Our data was mainly collected by two groups: the International Monetary Func (IMF) and the Carbon Discolure Project (CDP) with help from the ICLEI – Local Governments for Sustainability. The data on climate-related health issues and climate-related health hazards were gathered by the CDP/ICLEI through voluntary response questionnaires sent to cities. The data on climate-related health issues was gathered in 2021, while the data on climate-related health hazards were gathered in 2022. For the CDP/ICLEI, the purpose of gathering such data is to track progress on climate change initiatives, provide a dataset for tracking capital opportunities, and to allow cities to gather their own data to aide local decision-making.

The data we gathered on climate-related disaster frequency and governmental environmental protection expenditure history was gathered by the International Monetary Fund as part of their climate change indicators project. The data on climate change-related disasters was gathered through the The Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) and Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED) at Université catholique de Louvain (UCLouvain) in Belgium. The data on governmental environmental protection expenditures was gathered by the IMF’s statistics department. The purpose for gathering the data in both cases is to to provide a link between climate change considerations and global economics.

Across all of our data, the groups most likely to benefit from the data are investors who can use the data to inform on future investment opportunities. With that being said, the data is also useful for cities and larger governmental organizations to make policy decisions in relation to climate health concerns.

Both the CDP and the IMF are well known, reputable organizations that appear to very trustworthy. We obtained the data directly from the CDP and IMF websites, where the data is openly available for download.
